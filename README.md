Alternative method to https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git 
Intermediate users should probably use obsidian-git instead. 

This tutorial is intended for Windows users.

## 1 - Create a new repository on GitHub.com. 

Set to private, or the whole world will be able to access your vault.

## 2 - Click Code and Open with Github Desktop. 

If you do not have Github Desktop, install it and log in.
